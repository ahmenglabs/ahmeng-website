Ahmeng Labs was founded in June 2025. At the time, several members were chatting in a Discord voice channel until dawn. As the morning approached, with the atmosphere at its peak, we came up with the odd idea of ​​creating a small group.

We've been together for a few months. We've participated in several CTF competitions together. Everything's going well, but some members don't care about this group. They never show up to join the discussion or even read the messages. I hope the future of this little field will be greener.
